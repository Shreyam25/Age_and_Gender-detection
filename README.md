- It's an age and gender detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) - a type of deep learning algorithm that is great for
image recognition tasks.
- For this project, trained a CNN model using a large dataset of facial images with corresponding age and gender labels.
- The model is able to take in an input image of a face and predict the age and gender of the person in the image in facial features. 
- This can be used for a wide range of applications, from improving customer experiences in retail and marketing to helping law enforcement identify potential suspects.
- it could be used in marketing research to gather demographic data on customers, or in security systems for access control.
- It could also have medical applications, such as helping doctors determine a patient's age and gender for diagnosis and treatment.
